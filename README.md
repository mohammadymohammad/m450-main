# M450: Repeat unit testing in C#

This repository contains a small console application designed for practising the complete unit-testing workflow. The application calculates the price of an order from a unit price, a quantity, and an optional discount.

The repository deliberately contains **no test project and no unit tests**. Your task is to create them yourself, decide which cases matter, and run the tests. This lets you repeat the setup instead of only editing prepared tests.

## Requirements

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- An editor or IDE such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider

Check your installation:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## Explore and run the application

Restore and build the solution:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

Run the application with a unit price, quantity, and optional discount percentage:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/M450.UnitTesting.App -- 25.50 3 10
```

The result should be `68.85` because three items cost `76.50` before a 10% discount.

The calculation is in `PriceCalculator.cs`. It is separate from console input and output so that you can call it directly from unit tests.

## Exercise: create the test project

You can complete the exercise with either **xUnit** or **MSTest**. Choose one framework and run its command from the repository root. Do not run both commands because they use the same project name and directory.

### Option A: xUnit

```bash
dotnet new xunit \
  --name M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests \
  --output tests/M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests \
  --framework net10.0
```

The `xunit` template creates the project and adds the packages required to discover and run xUnit tests.

### Option B: MSTest

```bash
dotnet new mstest \
  --name M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests \
  --output tests/M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests \
  --framework net10.0
```

The `mstest` template creates the project and adds the packages required to discover and run MSTest tests.

### Finish the setup

After creating either project:

1. Add the test project to the solution:

   ```bash
   dotnet sln M450.UnitTesting.sln add tests/M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests
   ```

2. Add a reference from the test project to the application project:

   ```bash
   dotnet add tests/M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests/M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests.csproj reference src/M450.UnitTesting.App/M450.UnitTesting.App.csproj
   ```

3. Delete the generated `UnitTest1.cs` file and create `PriceCalculatorTests.cs` in the test project.

### Alternative: use Rider or Visual Studio

You do not have to use the command line to create and configure the test project. Rider and Visual Studio can perform the same steps through their user interfaces.

#### JetBrains Rider

1. Open `M450.UnitTesting.sln`.
2. In the Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and select **Add > New Project**.
3. Select project type **Unit Test** and type **xUnit**.
4. Name it `M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests`, choose the `tests` directory as its location, and create the project.
5. Right-click the new test project and select **Add > Add Reference**.
6. Select `M450.UnitTesting.App` and confirm the dialog.
7. Delete the generated `UnitTest1.cs` file and create `PriceCalculatorTests.cs`.

See [Get started with unit testing in Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Getting_Started_with_Unit_Testing.html) for additional guidance.

#### Visual Studio

1. Open `M450.UnitTesting.sln`.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution and select **Add > New Project**.
3. Search for `test`, then select either **xUnit Test Project** or **MSTest Test Project** for C#.
4. Name it `M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests`, choose the `tests` directory as its location, and create the project.
5. Under the new test project, right-click **Dependencies** and select **Add Project Reference**.
6. Select `M450.UnitTesting.App` and confirm the dialog.
7. Delete the generated `UnitTest1.cs` file and create `PriceCalculatorTests.cs`.

See [Unit test basics with Visual Studio Test Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/unit-test-basics?view=vs-2022) for additional guidance.

Whether you use the CLI or an IDE, verify that the test project is part of the solution and that its project file contains a `ProjectReference` to `M450.UnitTesting.App.csproj`.

At this point the solution should have this structure:

```text
M450.UnitTesting.sln
src/
  M450.UnitTesting.App/
    M450.UnitTesting.App.csproj
    PriceCalculator.cs
    Program.cs
tests/
  M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests/
    M450.UnitTesting.App.Tests.csproj
    PriceCalculatorTests.cs
```

## Exercise: write the tests

Write the tests yourself. First read the separate [Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) guide](AAA_PATTERN.md), then use that structure and descriptive names such as `CalculateTotal_WithValidValues_ReturnsExpectedTotal`.

Cover at least these behaviours:

- a price and quantity without a discount;
- a price and quantity with a discount;
- a quantity of zero;
- a discount of 100%;
- a negative unit price;
- a negative quantity;
- a discount below 0% or above 100%.

Use the attributes and assertions belonging to the framework you selected:

| Purpose | xUnit | MSTest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mark a test class | No attribute required | `[TestClass]` |
| One test case | `[Fact]` | `[TestMethod]` |
| Several inline cases | `[Theory]` with `[InlineData(...)]` | `[TestMethod]` with `[DataRow(...)]` |
| Compare expected and actual values | `Assert.Equal(expected, actual)` | `Assert.AreEqual(expected, actual)` |
| Verify an exception | `Assert.Throws<T>(...)` | `Assert.ThrowsExactly<T>(...)` |

For invalid inputs, verify both that an exception is thrown and that it is the expected exception type.

### If you chose xUnit

- Put `[Fact]` above a method that checks one example.
- Put `[Theory]` above a method and add one or more `[InlineData(...)]` attributes when the same behaviour should be checked with different inputs.
- A test class does not need a special class attribute.
- Use `Assert.Equal` for results and `Assert.Throws<T>` for expected exceptions.

See [Getting Started with xUnit](https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/getting-started) for more information.

### If you chose MSTest

- Put `[TestClass]` above the test class.
- Put `[TestMethod]` above each test method.
- Add one or more `[DataRow(...)]` attributes to a test method when the same behaviour should be checked with different inputs.
- Use `Assert.AreEqual` for results and `Assert.ThrowsExactly<T>` for expected exceptions.

See [Get started with C# and MSTest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-csharp-with-mstest) for more information.

Do not test the implementation line by line. Test the public behaviour of `PriceCalculator` so that the implementation can later change without requiring unrelated tests to change.

## Run the tests

From the repository root, run:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Also try these useful commands:

```bash
dotnet test --list-tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PriceCalculatorTests"
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

For the final check, run a clean build and all tests:

```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet test
```

## Repeat the workflow

To practise again, remove only the `tests` directory and its entry from the solution, then repeat the setup steps. Do not remove the application project.

Before finishing, be able to explain:

- why the test project needs a project reference;
- what Arrange, Act, and Assert mean;
- how xUnit facts and theories compare with MSTest test methods and data rows;
- why you selected xUnit or MSTest for your test project;
- why each test should be independent;
- what makes a useful test name.
